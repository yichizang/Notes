# Notes
These are notes I take on physics and mathematics. The banner pictures are not uploaded, so it may cause some trouble viewing. This can be fixed by removing the frontmatter in each `.md` file.

I tried to deploy a GitHub page with it but failed, as many of the markdown grammar I used here were based on Obsidian and it's not an open source editor so many of the formats can't be displayed properly. And I don't want to bother change them manually as this would interrupt my note-taking process. I will try other possible ways in the future.

Some of my earlier notes are taken in the format of `.tex`. I put them on my homepage http://phylab.fudan.edu.cn/doku.php?id=home:students:21300190008. I will translate them into markdown in the future.
