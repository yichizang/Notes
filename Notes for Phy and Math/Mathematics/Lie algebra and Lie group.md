# Lie group and Lie algebra
## 1 Lie group
### 1.1 Lie group
A *Lie group* $G$ is a [[Differential geometry#1.1.1 Manifold|manifold]] with a [[Abstract group theory#1.1 Group|group]] structure. That is with an identity element and smooth maps
- multiplication $G\times G\to G$;
- inverse $G\to G$.

The *dimension* of a Lie group is the dimension of the manifold.

### 1.2 Classical groups

>[!example]+
>Some examples of Lie group is given here.
>![[Abstract group theory#1.4 General linear group]]

The Lie groups mentioned above are called *classical groups*, which are all subgroups of $\mathrm{GL}(V)$. On the other hand, there are also exceptional Lie groups.

### 1.3 Translation map
For each element $g\in G$, one can define the *left/right translation map* as
$$
\begin{aligned}
L_g:&&G&\to G\\
&&h&\mapsto gh
\end{aligned}~;\qquad
\begin{aligned}
R_g:&&G&\to G\\
&&h&\mapsto hg.
\end{aligned}
$$
These two maps are both [[Differential geometry#1.1.3 Smooth map|diffeomorphism]] since there exist smooth inverse maps $L_{g^{-1}}$ and $R_{g^{-1}}$.

## 2 Lie algebra
### 2.1 Lie algebra
A *Lie algebra* $\mathfrak{g}$ is a [[Linear algebra#1.1 Definition|vector space]] with a multiplication called *Lie bracket*
$$
[\cdot,\cdot]:\mathfrak{g}\times\mathfrak{g}\to\mathfrak{g}.
$$
The Lie bracket satisfies
- bilinear $[aX+bY,Z]=a[X,Z]+b[Y,Z]$;
- antisymmetric $[X,Y]=-[Y,X]$;
- Jacobi identity $[X,[Y,Z]]+[Y,[Z,X]]+[Z,[X,Y]]=0$.

### 2.2 Structure constant
For a finite dimensional Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, one can choose a set of [[Linear algebra#1.4 Linear dependence and basis|basis]] $\{T_a\}$ so that $\forall X\in\mathfrak{g}$
$$
X=\sum_aX^aT_a,\quad X^a\in\mathbb{F}.
$$
Then the Lie bracket can be written as
$$
[X,Y]=X^aY^b[T_a,T_b].
$$

Since $[T_a,T_b]\in\mathfrak{g}$, one can decompose that under the same basis
$$
[T_a,T_b]=f_{ab}{}^cT_c,
$$
where $f_{ab}{}^c$ is the *structure constant*. Following from the antisymmetry and Jacobi identity, it satisfies
$$
\begin{aligned}
&f_{ab}{}^c+f_{ba}{}^c=0,\\
&f_{ab}{}^mf_{mc}{}^n+f_{bc}{}^mf_{ma}{}^n+f_{ca}{}^mf_{mb}{}^n=0.
\end{aligned}
$$

## 3 Lie algebra of Lie group
### 3.1 Tangent space of Lie group
For any Lie group $G$, the [[Differential geometry#1.2.2 Tangent space|tangent space]] of identity element forms a Lie algebra
$$
\mathfrak{g}=T_{1_G}G.
$$
The addition and Lie bracket are just natural addition and [[Differential geometry#1.2.4 Vector field|commutator]].

>[!example]
>For $\mathrm{GL}(n)$ (and its subgroups), a curve passing the identity element $\gamma(0)=1_G$ can be written as $\gamma(t)=\mathbb{1}_n+tA+O(t^2)$. Therefore, the Lie algebra is the set of all possible matrices $A$.

>\begin{aligned}
>\mathfrak{gl}(n,\mathbb{F})&=M_n(\mathbb{F}),\\
>\mathfrak{sl}(n,\mathbb{F})&=\{A\in M_n(\mathbb{F}):\mathrm{Tr}~A=0\},\\
>\mathfrak{u}(n)&=\{A\in M_n(\mathbb{C}):A+A^\dagger=0\},\\
>\mathfrak{su}(n)&=\{A\in\mathfrak{su}(n):\mathrm{Tr}~A=0\},\\
>\mathfrak{o}(n)&=\{A\in M_n(\mathbb{R}):A+A^T=0\},\\
>\mathfrak{so}(n)&=\{A\in\mathfrak{so}(n):\mathrm{Tr}~A=0\},\\
>\mathfrak{sp}(n)&=\{A\in M_{2n}(\mathbb{R}):A^TJ+JA=0\}.
>\end{aligned}

### 3.2 Exponential map
For a vector $X_0\in\mathfrak{g}$, the push forward map of $L_g$ generates a [[Differential geometry#1.2.4 Vector field|vector field]]
$$
X:g\mapsto(L_g)_\ast X_0.
$$
This is basically copying the vector to the entire manifold. Such a vector field satisfies $(L_g)_\ast X=X$ for any $g\in G$. Therefore it is called a *left invariant vector field*.

The [[Differential geometry#1.2.5 Flow|flow]] generated by the vector field is called the *exponential map*
$$
\exp:\mathfrak{g}\to G.
$$
In the case of classical groups, it can be written as
$$
\exp(tX)=\sum_n\frac{1}{n!}(tX)^n,
$$
where $X\in\mathfrak{g}$ is (generates) the vector field.

### 3.3 Dual Lie algebra
The [[Linear algebra#5.1 Dual space|dual space]] of $\mathfrak{g}$ is denoted as $\mathfrak{g}^\ast$. One can use similar way to generate a *left invariant 1-form*
$$
(L_g)^\ast\omega=\omega.
$$
In this way, $\omega(X)$ is a constant for a left invariant $X$. Therefore, $X(\omega(Y))=Y(\omega(X))=0$ and
$$
\mathrm{d}\omega=-\frac{1}{2}\omega([X,Y]).
$$

### 3.4 Adjoint action
The *adjoint actions* of (classical) Lie group and Lie algebra are defined as follows.
- The adjoint action of $G$ on itself is defined by
$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{Ad}:&&G\times G&\to G\\
&&(g,h)&\mapsto\mathrm{Ad}_gh\doteq ghg^{-1};
\end{aligned}
$$
- The adjoint action of $G$ on $\mathfrak{g}$ is defined by
$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{Ad}:&&G\times\mathfrak{g}&\to\mathfrak{g}\\
&&(g,X)&\mapsto\mathrm{Ad}_gX\doteq gXg^{-1};
\end{aligned}
$$
- The adjoint action of $G$ on the dual Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}^\ast$ is defined by
$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{Ad}^\ast:&&G\times\mathfrak{g}^\ast&\to\mathfrak{g}^\ast\\
&&(g,\omega)&\mapsto\mathrm{Ad}^\ast_g\omega\doteq\omega\circ\mathrm{Ad}_{g^{-1}};
\end{aligned}
$$
- The adjoint action of $\mathfrak{g}$ on itself is defined by
$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{ad}:&&\mathfrak{g}\times\mathfrak{g}&\to\mathfrak{g}\\
&&(X,Y)&\mapsto\mathrm{ad}_XY\doteq[X,Y];
\end{aligned}
$$
- The adjoint action of $\mathfrak{g}$ on its dual is defined by
$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{ad}^\ast:&&\mathfrak{g}\times\mathfrak{g}^\ast&\to\mathfrak{g}^\ast\\
&&(X,\omega)&\mapsto\mathrm{ad}_X\omega\doteq\omega\circ(-\mathrm{ad}_X).
\end{aligned}
$$

## 4 Group action on manifolds
### 4.1 $G$-action
A *left $G$-action* on a manifold $M$ is defined as the map
$$
L:G\times M\to M
$$
that satisfies
- $L_g\circ L_h=L_{gh}$;
- $L_{1_G}=1_M$.

Similarly, one can define a *right action* $R_g$.

When $M=G$, the $G$-action is just translation map.

### 4.2 Homogenous space
If a manifold $M$ satisfies that for any two points $x,y\in M$, there is a $G$-action connecting them
$$
L_gx=y,
$$
then the $G$-action on $M$ is called *transitive*. The manifold $M$ is called a *homogenous space* of group $G$. As a special case, $G$ is a homogenous space of itself.

Generally, the submanifold $O_G(p)\subset M$ that can be reached by $G$-action is called the *$G$-orbit* of $p$
$$
O_G(p)\doteq\{L_gp:g\in G\}.
$$

### 4.3 Stabilizer subgroup
A subgroup $H_p\subset G$ that preserves point $p\in M$ is called a *stabilizer (isometry) subgroup* of $G$
$$
H_p\doteq\{g:L_gp=p\}.
$$
One can show that this subgroup is independent (up to isomorphism) of the choice of $p$, therefore it can be denoted as $H$.

One can prove that there exists a [[Differential geometry#1.1.3 Smooth map|diffeomorphism]] between the [[Abstract group theory#6.5 Normal subgroups and quotient group|quotient group]] $G/H$ and the homogenous space $M$
$$
\begin{aligned}
G/H&\cong M\\
gH&\mapsto L_gp.
\end{aligned}
$$
