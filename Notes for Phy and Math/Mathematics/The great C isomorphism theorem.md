# The great $\mathbb{C}$ isomorphism theorem
## 1 The great $\mathbb{C}$ isomorphism theorem
This is an significant achievement of myself. I came up with it one night returning to my dorm with my roommate. The complete version was also inspired by him.

To understand the great $\mathbb{C}$ isomorphism theorem, one need to first understand a lemma given as follow.

Any mathematical or physics statement or theorem is isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^2$. The proof is simple. One only need to note that any mathematical or physics statement or theorem human could study must be written on sketch paper. Apparently a paper surface is isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^2$, thus the proof is done.

Using this lemma and the fact that $\mathbb{R}^2\cong\mathbb{C}$, one can prove the great $\mathbb{C}$ isomorphism theorem.

## 2 Consequence of the theorem
The reason why we want to construct an isomorphism onto the complex field $\mathbb{C}$ is that holomorphic functions on $\mathbb{C}$ have very nice properties. Namely, a holomorphic function is completely determined by its boundary value. Also with the help of analytic continuation theorem, one can obtain the full picture of a holomorphic function from its fragment.

Suppose one can prove that some open question is holomorphic when mapped onto $\mathbb{C}$, then with the slight information of the statement, one can use analytic continuation to finish the entire proof or statement. This could potentially be a powerful tool in both mathematics and physics.

## 3 Superiority of traditional Chinese culture
From the above discussion, one can see that a key factor in the usage of the great $\mathbb{C}$ isomorphism theorem is that the statement to be proved must be a holomorphic function on the plane.

Since the modern technology and writting tools draw letters and symbols with high contract, the blank space on the scratch paper must have zero value. Then it can't be viewed as a holomorphic function since a holomorphic function requires isolated null points.

On the other hand, traditional Chinese writting tool, writting brush and Chinese ink has the chance to blur the strokes so that the blanks also have nonzero values, which makes it possible that the function being holomorphic. This definitely shows the superiority of traditional Chinese culture.
