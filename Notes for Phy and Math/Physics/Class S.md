First consider $G=\mathrm{SU}(2)$.
- $N_f=0$ has two monopoles at $\pm\Lambda^2$;
- $N_f=1$ has two monopoles and a dyon at $u$;
- $N_f=2$ ...

The configuration: $N$ $D_4$ branes at dimension $(0,1,2,3,6)$ and $2$ $NS_5$ branes at dimension $(0,1,2,3,4,5)$. At UV, the $D_4$ branes are stacked together and the W-bosons crossing them are massless. At IR, they are at different positions $\phi_k$ and W-bosons have mass.

After a while...

II A theory on $\mathbb{R}^{1,9}$ = M theory on $\mathbb{R}^{1,9}\times S_1$. The radius of $S_1$ is $g_sl_s$.

Define
$$
\begin{aligned}
v&=\frac{x^4+ix^5}{l_s^2}\\
t&=\exp\left(\frac{x^6+ix^{10}}{g_sl_s}\right).
\end{aligned}
$$
The equation $F(v,t)=0$ where $F$ is holomorphic.
- $t$ has 2 solutions, which makes the equation $A(v)t^2+B(v)t+C(v)=0$;
- at $x^6\to\infty$, there is no solution, which means $A(v),C(v)$ are consts;
- $v$ has $N$ solutions for $G=\mathrm{SU}(N)$, which gives $t^2-\Lambda^{-N}t\prod(v-\phi_i)+1=0$.

The W-boson: slice of tube?

Monopole ($D_2$ brane): note that NS5 and D4 are all M5 in M theory, therefore there is no distinction between them.

Adding flavor: attach more D4 at both sides.
