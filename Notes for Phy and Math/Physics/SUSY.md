Two types of sym. in SM.:
- Poincare: defines different types of particles
- Internal: don't change type of particle. In SM. $SU(3)\times SU(2)\times U(1)$
In nonrelativistic quark model, the $SU(3)$ can be turned into $SU(6)$. However, this can't be generalized to relativistic case.

No-Go theorem: can't be.

Coleman Mandula theorem: the Lie algebra rep. of a quantum system can have sym. only of Poincare $\times$ Internal.

In SUSY, by generalizing Lie algebra to Lie superalgebra, can break the restriction.
