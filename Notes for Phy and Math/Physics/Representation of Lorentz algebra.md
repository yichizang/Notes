# Representation of Lorentz algebra
## 1 Poincare group
### 1.1 Poincare group
The *Poincare group* is the group of transformations that preserve the Minkowski matrix $\eta_{\mu\nu}$. An element of Poincare group is in the form of
$$
x^\mu\to\Lambda^\mu{}_\nu x^\nu+a^\nu,
$$
where $\Lambda^\mu{}_\nu$ is the Lorentz transformation matrix and $a^\mu$ is a displacement. One can denote such an element as $T(\Lambda,a)$.

### 1.2 Lorentz group
The subgroup of Poincare group with $a^\mu=0$ is called *Lorentz group*, denoted as $O(1,3)$. It has four disconnected branches.

The branch with $\det\Lambda=1$ and $\Lambda^0{}_0\geqslant1$ is a subgroup called the *restricted Lorentz group*, denoted as $SO(1,3)$. It's group elements are Lorentz transformations that preserve the time direction and space orientation. Sometimes one simply refer to $SO(1,3)$ as Lorentz group.
