# Representation of Lorentz algebra
## 1 Poincare group
### 1.1 Poincare group
The *Poincare group* is the group of transformations that preserve the Minkowski matrix $\eta_{\mu\nu}$. An element of Poincare group is in the form of
$$
x^\mu\to\Lambda^\mu{}_\nu x^\nu+a^\nu,
$$
where $\Lambda^\mu{}_\nu$ is the Lorentz transformation matrix and $a^\mu$ is a displacement. One can denote such an element as $T(\Lambda,a)$.

### 1.2 Lorentz group
The subgroup of Poincare group with $a^\mu=0$ is called *Lorentz group*, denoted as $O(1,3)$. It has four disconnected branches.

The branch with $\det\Lambda=1$ and $\Lambda^0{}_0\geqslant1$ is a subgroup called the *restricted Lorentz group*, denoted as $SO(1,3)$. It's group elements are Lorentz transformations that preserve the time direction and space orientation. Sometimes one simply refer to $SO(1,3)$ as Lorentz group.

### 1.3 Lorentz Lie algebra
An infinitesimal Poincare transformation $T(\Lambda,a)$ can be written as
$$
T(\Lambda,a)=\exp\left(-\frac{i}{2}\omega_{\mu\nu}J^{\mu\nu}+ia_\mu P^\mu\right)=1-\frac{i}{2}\omega_{\mu\nu}J^{\mu\nu}+ia^\mu P^\mu,
$$
where $\omega_{\mu\nu}$ has antisymmetric index. Therefore, the generators of Pincare transformation are $J^{\mu\nu}$ and $P^\mu$. They form the *Poincare Lie algebra*. Through multiplication rules of Poincare group, one can work out the structure constant of Poincare Lie algebra
$$
\begin{aligned}[]
[J^{\mu\nu},J^{\rho\sigma}]&=i(\eta^{\nu\rho}J^{\mu\sigma}-\eta^{\mu\rho}J^{\nu\sigma}-\eta^{\nu\sigma}J^{\mu\rho}+\eta^{\mu\sigma}J^{\nu\rho}),\\
[P^\mu,J^{\rho\sigma}]&=i(\eta^{\mu\rho}P^\sigma-\eta^{\mu\sigma}P^\rho),\\
[P^\mu,P^\nu]&=0.
\end{aligned}
$$

When considering only generators of Lorentz transformation $J^{\mu\nu}$, the result is called the *Lorentz Lie algebra*, denoted as $\mathfrak{so}(1,3)$.

### 1.4 Casimir operators
One can also obtain the Casimir operator in the Poincare Lie algebra as
$$
\begin{aligned}[]
[J^{\mu\nu},P^2]&=0,\\
[P^\mu,P^2]&=0.
\end{aligned}
$$
Another Casimir operator is $W^2$, where $W^\mu$ is the *Pauli-Ljubanski polarization vector*
$$
W_\mu\doteq\frac{1}{2}\epsilon_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}P^\nu J^{\rho\sigma}.
$$
Then the Casimir is given by
$$
W^2=-\frac{1}{2}J_{\mu\nu}J^{\mu\nu}P^2+J^{\mu\rho}J_{\nu\rho}P_\mu P^\nu.
$$

## 2 Representation of $\mathfrak{so}(1,3)$
### 2.1 Structure of $\mathfrak{so}(1,3)$
Since the indices of $J^{\mu\nu}$ are anticommutating, one can define
$$
J_i\doteq\frac{1}{2}\epsilon_{ijk}J^{jk},\quad K_i\doteq J^{0i}.
$$
Then the commutation relation becomes
$$
[J_i,J_j]=i\epsilon_{ijk}J_k,\quad[J_i,K_j]=i\epsilon_{ijk}K_k,\quad[K_i,K_j]=-i\epsilon_{ijk}J_k.
$$
If one further define
$$
M_i\doteq\frac{1}{2}(J_i+iK_i),\quad N_i\doteq\frac{1}{2}(J_i-iK_i),
$$
then the commutation relations become
$$
[M_i,M_j]=i\epsilon_{ijk}M_k,\quad[N_i,N_j]=i\epsilon_{ijk}N_k,\quad[M_i,N_j]=0.
$$
This implies that $M_i$ and $N_i$ generates an $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ subalgebra respectively. Therefore one can write
$$
\mathfrak{so}(1,3)=\mathfrak{su}(2)\oplus\mathfrak{su}(2).
$$
Note that there are actually some ambiguity about complexation of $\mathfrak{so}(1,3)$ here.

### 2.2 Irreducible representations of $\mathfrak{su}(2)$
An irreducible representation of $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ is a representation on the vector space spanned by $\ket{j,m}$. The Casimir operator $J^2$ acting on $\ket{j,m}$ gives
$$
J^2\ket{j,m}=j(j+1)\ket{j,m}.
$$
The dimension of such a representation is $2j+1$.

The number $j$ here is used to lable different representations here
$$
(j_1,j_2)\doteq(j_1)_{\mathfrak{su}(2)}\otimes(j_2)_{\mathfrak{su}(2)}.
$$

>This section requires perfection.

### 2.3 Scalar representation
The trivial representation $(0,0)$ is also called the *scalar representation* of $\mathfrak{so}(1,3)$. It corresponds to the Lorentz scalar which is invarient under Lorentz transformation.

### 2.4 Spinor representation
The representation $(1/2,0)$ and $(0,1/2)$ are also called *spinor representation*. The corresponding vectors are called *left/right handed Weyl spinor* respectively. The generator of Lorentz transformation under this two representations are
$$
S^{ij}=\frac{1}{2}\epsilon^{ijk}\sigma^k,\quad S^{0i}_L=-\frac{i}{2}\sigma^i,\quad S^{0i}_R=\frac{i}{2}\sigma^i.
$$

### 2.5 Dirac spinor
The direct sum of these two representations is also a commenly used representation called *Dirac spinor representation*. The Lorentz transformation generator is the [[Dirac algebra#1 Introduction|Dirac matrix]]
$$
S^{\mu\nu}=\frac{1}{2}\sigma^{\mu\nu}.
$$
The Lorentz transformation matrix generated by this generator is denoted as $\Lambda_{\frac{1}{2}}$.

Define the *orthogonal projection operator* as
$$
\mathbb{P}_\pm\doteq\frac{1}{2}(1_\gamma\pm\gamma^5).
$$
With this operator, one can project out one Weyl spinor out of the Dirac spinor
$$
\mathbb{P}_+\psi=\begin{pmatrix}
0\\
\psi_R
\end{pmatrix},\quad\mathbb{P}_-\psi=\begin{pmatrix}
\psi_L\\
0
\end{pmatrix}.
$$

### 2.6 Dotted-undotted notation
Denote the left/right handed Weyl spinor as $(\psi_L)_a$ and $(\psi_R)_A$ respectively, with the spinor index given explicitly. One can lower or raise the index by Levi-Civita symbol
$$
(\psi_L)^a\doteq\epsilon^{ab}(\psi_L)_b,\quad(\psi_R)^A\doteq-\epsilon^{AB}(\psi_R)_B.
$$
Under the *dotted-undotted notation*, one denote a right handed upper index as a dotted lower index
$$
(\psi_R)_{\dot{a}}\doteq(\psi_R)^A.
$$
This is attached with the restriction that a dotted index can only contract with another dotted index, vise versa. Doing conjugate of Weyl spinor will also change the dottedness of index
$$
((\psi_L)_a)^\ast=(\psi_L^\ast)_{\dot{a}}.
$$

Since Pauli matrix can turn a left (right) handed spinor into the conjugate of a right (left) handed spinor, its index is written as
$$
-i(\sigma^2)_{a\dot{a}}(\psi_R)^{\dot{a}}=((\psi_L)_a)^\ast.
$$
What a terrible notation!

### 2.7 Vector representation
The representation $(1/2,1/2)=(1/2,0)\otimes(0,1/2)$ is the *vector representation*. The transformation matrix is just the ordinary Lorentz transformation matrix $\Lambda^a{}_b$. The generator of vector representation is given by
$$
(J^{\rho\sigma})^\mu{}_\nu=i(\eta^{\rho\mu}\delta^\sigma{}_\nu-\eta^{\sigma\mu}\delta^\rho{}_\nu).
$$
Therefore an infinitesimal transformation is simply
$$
\Lambda^\mu{}_\nu=\delta^\mu{}_\nu-\frac{i}{2}\omega_{\rho\sigma}(J^{\rho\sigma})^\mu{}_\nu=\delta^\mu{}_\nu+\omega^\mu{}_\nu.
$$
