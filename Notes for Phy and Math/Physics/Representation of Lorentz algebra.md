# Representation of Lorentz algebra
## 1 Poincare group
### 1.1 Poincare group
The *Poincare group* is the group of transformations that preserve the Minkowski matrix $\eta_{\mu\nu}$. An element of Poincare group is in the form of
$$
x^\mu\to\Lambda^\mu{}_\nu x^\nu+a^\nu,
$$
where $\Lambda^\mu{}_\nu$ is the Lorentz transformation matrix and $a^\mu$ is a displacement. One can denote such an element as $T(\Lambda,a)$.

The Poincare group can be viewed as the semi-direct product of Lorentz group and translation group with multiplication rule
$$
T(\Lambda_1,a_1)T(\Lambda_2,a_2)=T(\Lambda_1\Lambda_2,\Lambda_1a_2+a_1).
$$

### 1.2 Lorentz group
The subgroup of Poincare group with $a^\mu=0$ is called *Lorentz group*
$$
L=\rm{O}(1,3)\doteq\{\Lambda\in\mathrm{GL}(4,\mathbb{R}):\Lambda^T\eta\Lambda=\eta\}.
$$
It has four disconnected branches. To distinguish them, denote the following
- the *proper Lorentz transformations* are the ones with determinant $1$
$$
L_+=\mathrm{SO}(1,3)\doteq\{\Lambda\in L:\det\Lambda=+1\};
$$
- the *improper Lorentz transformations* are the ones with determinant $-1$
$$
L_-\doteq\{\Lambda\in L:\det\Lambda=-1\};
$$
- the *orthochronous Lorentz transformations* are the ones with positive time component
$$
L^\uparrow\doteq\{\Lambda\in L:\Lambda^0{}_0\geqslant1\};
$$
- the *non-orthochronous Lorentz transformations* are the ones with negative time component
$$
L^\downarrow\doteq\{\Lambda\in L:\Lambda^0{}_0\leqslant-1\}.
$$

Especially, the branch with $\det\Lambda=1$ and $\Lambda^0{}_0\geqslant1$ is a subgroup called the *restricted Lorentz group*, denoted as $L_+^\uparrow$. It's group elements are Lorentz transformations that preserve the time direction and space orientation. Sometimes one simply refer to $L_+^\uparrow$ as Lorentz group.

### 1.3 Lorentz Lie algebra
An infinitesimal Poincare transformation $T(\Lambda,a)$ can be written as
$$
T(\Lambda,a)=\exp\left(-\frac{i}{2}\omega_{\mu\nu}J^{\mu\nu}+ia_\mu P^\mu\right)=1-\frac{i}{2}\omega_{\mu\nu}J^{\mu\nu}+ia^\mu P^\mu,
$$
where $\omega_{\mu\nu}$ has antisymmetric index. Therefore, the generators of Poincare transformation are $J^{\mu\nu}$ and $P^\mu$. They form the *Poincare Lie algebra*. Through multiplication rules of Poincare group, one can work out the structure constant of Poincare Lie algebra
$$
\begin{aligned}[]
[J^{\mu\nu},J^{\rho\sigma}]&=i(\eta^{\nu\rho}J^{\mu\sigma}-\eta^{\mu\rho}J^{\nu\sigma}-\eta^{\nu\sigma}J^{\mu\rho}+\eta^{\mu\sigma}J^{\nu\rho}),\\
[P^\mu,J^{\rho\sigma}]&=i(\eta^{\mu\rho}P^\sigma-\eta^{\mu\sigma}P^\rho),\\
[P^\mu,P^\nu]&=0.
\end{aligned}
$$

When considering only generators of Lorentz transformation $J^{\mu\nu}$, the result is called the *Lorentz Lie algebra*, denoted as $\mathfrak{so}(1,3)$.

### 1.4 Casimir operators
One can also obtain the Casimir operator in the Poincare Lie algebra as
$$
\begin{aligned}[]
[J^{\mu\nu},P^2]&=0,\\
[P^\mu,P^2]&=0.
\end{aligned}
$$
Another Casimir operator is $W^2$, where $W^\mu$ is the *Pauli-Lubanski polarization vector*
$$
W_\mu\doteq\frac{1}{2}\epsilon_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}P^\nu J^{\rho\sigma}.
$$
Then the Casimir is given by
$$
W^2=-\frac{1}{2}J_{\mu\nu}J^{\mu\nu}P^2+J^{\mu\rho}J_{\nu\rho}P_\mu P^\nu.
$$

### 1.5 Little group
The Lorentz group is a non-compact group. Therefore it has no finite dimensional unitary representation. To study its unitary representations, one choose a frame where the non-compact transformations are fixed. The group of the rest transformations is called *little group*.

For massive particle, one can choose the frame where $p^\mu=(m,0,0,0)$. The little group is then $\mathrm{SO}(3)$. Its representation is labelled by the spin $s$, with dimension $2s+1$. The spin can be given by the Pauli-Lubanski $W^2=m^2s(s+1)$.

For massless particle, one can choose the frame $p^\mu=(E,0,0,E)$. The little group is generated by
$$
N_1=J_{10}+J_{13},\quad N_2=J_{20}+J_{23},\quad J_{12}.
$$
Since $N_1$ and $N_2$ are non-compact generator, one only consider the group generated by $J_{12}$, which is $\mathrm{SO}(2)$. It is labelled by helicity $\lambda$.

Generally, the little group for massive particles is $\mathrm{SO}(d-1)$ and for massless particles contains only $\mathrm{SO}(d-2)$.

## 2 Representations of Lorentz algebra
### 2.1 Tensor representation
#### 2.1.1 Trivial representation
The *trivial* representation or the *scalar* representation of $\mathfrak{so}(1,3)$ is the 1 dimesional trivial representation denoted as $\pmb{1}$. The Lorentz generator is
$$
J^{\rho\sigma}_{\pmb{1}}=0.
$$

#### 2.1.2 Vector representation
The *vector* representation is a $d$ dimensional representation denoted as $\mathrm{\pmb{d}}$. The Lorentz generator is
$$
(J^{\rho\sigma}_{\mathrm{\pmb{d}}})^\mu{}_\nu=i(\eta^{\rho\mu}\delta^\sigma{}_\nu-\eta^{\sigma\mu}\delta^\rho{}_\nu).
$$
The vector representation is an [[../Mathematics/Representation theory#1.1.1 Definition of representation|irreducible representation]].

#### 2.1.3 Tensor representation
Generally, a *tensor* representation of the form $\mathrm{\pmb{d}}\otimes\cdots\otimes\mathrm{\pmb{d}}$ is a reducible representation. Consider the special case of rank 2 tensor representation. It can be decomposed into the symmetric tensor representation and anti-symmetric tensor representation
$$
\mathrm{\pmb{d}}\otimes\mathrm{\pmb{d}}=(\mathrm{\pmb{d}}\otimes_S\mathrm{\pmb{d}})\oplus(\mathrm{\pmb{d}}\otimes_A\mathrm{\pmb{d}}).
$$

By acting on the invarient tensors (in the case of $\mathfrak{so}(1,3)$, they are metrics $\eta_{\mu\nu}$ and totally antisymmetric tensor $\epsilon_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}$), one can further decompose the two subrepresentations.

#### 2.1.4 Symmetric component
For the symmetric component, applying $\eta_{\mu\nu}$ implies that the tensor can be decomposed into the traceless symmetric tensor part $\mathrm{\pmb{S}}$ and its trace part
$$
\mathrm{\pmb{d}}\otimes_S\mathrm{\pmb{d}}=\mathrm{\pmb{1}}\oplus\mathrm{\pmb{S}}.
$$
The projection operator $\mathrm{\pmb{d}}\otimes_S\mathrm{\pmb{d}}\to\mathrm{\pmb{S}}$ can be constructed as
$$
P^{\rho\sigma}_{\mu\nu}\doteq\frac{1}{2}(\delta^\rho_\mu\delta^\sigma_\nu+\delta^\sigma_\mu\delta^\rho_\nu)-\frac{1}{d}\eta_{\mu\nu}\eta^{\rho\sigma}.
$$

#### 2.1.5 Anti-symmetric component
Write an element in the representation $\mathrm{\pmb{d}}\otimes_A\mathrm{\pmb{d}}$ as $\phi_{[\mu\nu]}$. In the case of $d=4$, one can use [[../Mathematics/Riemannian geometry#2.1 Hodge $ ast$-operator|Hodge operator]] to map one tensor to another
$$
\ast\phi^{[\mu\nu]}=\frac{1}{2}\epsilon^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}\phi_{[\rho\sigma]}.
$$
Since $\ast(\ast\phi)=-\phi$, $\phi$ can be decomposed into two types of tensors
$$
\ast\phi=i\phi,\quad\ast\phi=-i\phi.
$$
Denote these two representations as $\mathrm{\pmb{3}}^\pm$. Note that under complex conjugate $(\mathrm{\pmb{3}}^\pm)^\ast=\mathrm{\pmb{3}}^\mp$. One can then decompose
$$
\mathrm{\pmb{4}}\otimes_A\mathrm{\pmb{4}}=\mathrm{\pmb{3}}^+\oplus\mathrm{\pmb{3}}^-.
$$

### 2.2 Spinor representation
#### 2.2.1 Dirac spinor
From the [[Dirac algebra|Dirac matrics]], one can construct the *Dirac spinor* representation
$$
J^{\mu\nu}=\frac{i}{4}[\gamma^\mu,\gamma^\nu].
$$
This is a 4 dimensional representation.

Since $[\gamma^5,J^{\mu\nu}]=0$ and $\gamma^5$ can be diagnolized as $\mathrm{diag}\{+1,+1,-1,-1\}$ (traceless), $J^{\mu\nu}$ can be block diagnolized. Therefore Dirac spinor representation is reducible.

#### 2.2.2 Weyl spinor
With the projection map
$$
\mathbb{P}_\pm\doteq\frac{1}{2}(1_\gamma\pm\gamma^5),
$$
one can project the Dirac spinor to two subrepresentations $\mathrm{\pmb{2_L}}$ and $\mathrm{\pmb{2_R}}$, called *Weyl spinor* representations. These subrepresentations are irreducible.

#### 2.2.3 Majorana spinor
One can write the similarity relation
$$
\mathcal{BC}J^{\mu\nu}(\mathcal{BC})^{-1}=-(J^{\mu\nu})^\ast.
$$
Write an element in the Dirac spinor representation as $\Psi$. This means that $\Psi^\ast$ transforms in the same way as $\mathcal{BC}\Psi$. Therefore one can define the subspace of $\Psi$ that satisfies
$$
\Psi^\ast=\mathcal{BC}\Psi
$$
as a subrepresentation called *Majorana spinor* representation. This is also a 2 dimensional irreducible representation. It is required that $(\mathcal{BC})^\ast\mathcal{BC}=1_\gamma$. In 4 dimensional space-time, it can be taken
$$
\mathcal{BC}=\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\
0 & 0 & -1 & 0\\
0 & -1 & 0 & 0\\
1 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{pmatrix}.
$$

#### 2.2.4 More spinors
In a general space-time, the Majorana projection can be generalized to
$$
\gamma^\ast=\mp\mathcal{BC}\gamma(\mathcal{BC})^{-1},\quad\Psi^\ast=\mathcal{BC}\Psi
$$
with condition $(\mathcal{BC})^\ast\mathcal{BC}=1_\gamma$. When taking minus sign, such representation is called *pseudo-Majorana spinor*. Such spinors exists in $d=0,1,2,3,4\mod 8$.

In $d=2\mod 8$, the Majorana and Weyl projection commutes. Therefore one can define the *Majorana-Weyl spinor* representation.

### 2.3 Relationship with $\mathfrak{su}(2)$
#### 2.3.1 Structure of $\mathfrak{so}(1,3)$
Since the indices of $J^{\mu\nu}$ are anticommutating, one can define
$$
J_i\doteq\frac{1}{2}\epsilon_{ijk}J^{jk},\quad K_i\doteq J^{0i}.
$$
Then the commutation relation becomes
$$
[J_i,J_j]=i\epsilon_{ijk}J_k,\quad[J_i,K_j]=i\epsilon_{ijk}K_k,\quad[K_i,K_j]=-i\epsilon_{ijk}J_k.
$$
If one further define
$$
M_i\doteq\frac{1}{2}(J_i+iK_i),\quad N_i\doteq\frac{1}{2}(J_i-iK_i),
$$
then the commutation relations become
$$
[M_i,M_j]=i\epsilon_{ijk}M_k,\quad[N_i,N_j]=i\epsilon_{ijk}N_k,\quad[M_i,N_j]=0.
$$
This implies that $M_i$ and $N_i$ generates an $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ subalgebra respectively. Therefore one can write
$$
\mathfrak{so}(1,3)^{\mathbb{C}}=\mathfrak{su}(2)\oplus\mathfrak{su}(2).
$$
Note that this requires a complexation of $\mathfrak{so}(1,3)$ here. But one can prove that there is a one-one correspondence between the representation of a complex Lie algebra and the representation of its real form. Therefore, it makes no difference.

#### 2.3.2 Irreducible representations of $\mathfrak{su}(2)$
An irreducible representation of $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ is a representation on the vector space spanned by $\ket{j,m}$. The Casimir operator $J^2$ acting on $\ket{j,m}$ gives
$$
J^2\ket{j,m}=j(j+1)\ket{j,m}.
$$
The dimension of such a representation is $2j+1$.

The number $j$ here is used to lable different representations here
$$
(j_1,j_2)\doteq(j_1)_{\mathfrak{su}(2)}\otimes(j_2)_{\mathfrak{su}(2)}.
$$

#### 2.3.3 Scalar representation
The trivial representation $(0,0)$ is also called the *scalar representation* of $\mathfrak{so}(1,3)$. It corresponds to the Lorentz scalar which is invarient under Lorentz transformation.

#### 2.3.4 Spinor representation
The representation $(1/2,0)$ and $(0,1/2)$ are also called *spinor representation*. The corresponding vectors are called *left/right handed Weyl spinor* respectively. The generator of Lorentz transformation under this two representations are
$$
S^{ij}=\frac{1}{2}\epsilon^{ijk}\sigma^k,\quad S^{0i}_L=-\frac{i}{2}\sigma^i,\quad S^{0i}_R=\frac{i}{2}\sigma^i.
$$

#### 2.3.5 Dirac spinor
The direct sum of these two representations is also a commenly used representation called *Dirac spinor representation*. The Lorentz transformation generator is the [[Dirac algebra#1 Introduction|Dirac matrix]]
$$
S^{\mu\nu}=\frac{1}{2}\sigma^{\mu\nu}.
$$
The Lorentz transformation matrix generated by this generator is denoted as $\Lambda_{\frac{1}{2}}$.

Define the *orthogonal projection operator* as
$$
\mathbb{P}_\pm\doteq\frac{1}{2}(1_\gamma\pm\gamma^5).
$$
With this operator, one can project out one Weyl spinor out of the Dirac spinor
$$
\mathbb{P}_+\psi=\begin{pmatrix}
0\\
\psi_R
\end{pmatrix},\quad\mathbb{P}_-\psi=\begin{pmatrix}
\psi_L\\
0
\end{pmatrix}.
$$

#### 2.3.6 Vector representation
The representation $(1/2,1/2)=(1/2,0)\otimes(0,1/2)$ is the *vector representation*. The transformation matrix is just the ordinary Lorentz transformation matrix $\Lambda^a{}_b$. The generator of vector representation is given by
$$
(J^{\rho\sigma})^\mu{}_\nu=i(\eta^{\rho\mu}\delta^\sigma{}_\nu-\eta^{\sigma\mu}\delta^\rho{}_\nu).
$$
Therefore an infinitesimal transformation is simply
$$
\Lambda^\mu{}_\nu=\delta^\mu{}_\nu-\frac{i}{2}\omega_{\rho\sigma}(J^{\rho\sigma})^\mu{}_\nu=\delta^\mu{}_\nu+\omega^\mu{}_\nu.
$$

### 2.4 Dotted-undotted notation
#### 2.4.1 $\mathrm{SL}(2;\mathbb{C})$ and Lorentz group
Consider the vector space of $2\times 2$ complex Hermitian metrics
$$
\mathbb{H}(2;\mathbb{C})\doteq\{X\in\mathrm{GL}(2;\mathbb{C}):X=X^\dagger\}=\mathrm{span}\{\sigma^\mu\}.
$$
There is a one-one map from Minkowski space-time $\mathbb{R}^{1,3}$ to $\mathbb{H}(2;\mathbb{C})$
$$
x^\mu\mapsto x^\mu\sigma_\mu.
$$
The norm on $\mathbb{H}(2;\mathbb{C})$ is
$$
\det X=x_\mu x^\mu.
$$
Therefore, the adjoint group action of $\mathrm{SL}(2;\mathbb{C})$ on $\mathbb{H}(2;\mathbb{C})$
$$
X\mapsto MXM^\dagger,
$$
preserving norm (determinant) corresponds to the Lorentz group action on $\mathbb{R}^{1,3}$. The correspondence is given by
$$
\Lambda^\mu{}_\nu(M)=\frac{1}{2}\mathrm{Tr}(\sigma^\mu M\bar\sigma_\nu M^\dagger).
$$

#### 2.4.2 Weyl spinor
Consider two representations of $\mathrm{SL}(2;\mathbb{C})$. For self representation $\rho(M)=M$, the representation space is denoted as $F$. The $\mathrm{SL}(2;\mathbb{C})$ action on an element $\psi\in F$ is denoted as
$$
\psi'_A=M_A{}^B\psi_B.
$$
This is called the *left-handed Weyl spinor*.

For the complex conjugate self representation $\rho(M)=M^\ast$, the representation space is denoted as $\dot{F}$. The group action on an element $\bar{\psi}\in\dot{F}$ is denoted as
$$
\bar{\psi}'_{\dot{A}}=(M^\ast)_{\dot{A}}{}^{\dot{B}}\bar{\psi}_{\dot{B}}.
$$
This is called the *right-handed Weyl spinor*.

#### 2.4.3 Grassmann numbers as component
The representation space $F$ and $\dot{F}$ are "2 dimensional vector spaces". What's special is that the components are all [[Grassmann variables]] with dimension $n=2$.

When there are multiple spinors, they are considered in different spaces like $F_1,F_2,\dot{F}_3$ etc. In this case, the Grassmann variables have dimension $n=2N$.

#### 2.4.4 Changing indices
Using Levi-Civita symbol $\epsilon^{AB}$ and $\bar{\epsilon}^{\dot{A}\dot{B}}$, one can raise the indices of Weyl spinor
$$
\psi^A=\epsilon^{AB}\psi_B,\quad\bar\psi^{\dot{A}}=\bar\epsilon^{\dot{A}\dot{B}}\bar\psi_{\dot{B}}.
$$
This is acturally mapping to dual spaces $F\to F^\ast$ and $\dot{F}\to\dot{F}^\ast$. In the same way, $\epsilon_{AB}$ and $\bar{\epsilon}_{\dot{A}\dot{B}}$ can be used to lower indices. The convention is to take $\epsilon^{12}=\bar\epsilon^{\dot{1}\dot{2}}=-\epsilon_{12}=-\bar\epsilon_{\dot{1}\dot{2}}=+1$.

There also exists a map $\bar\sigma^0:F\to\dot{F}^\ast$ and its inverse map $\sigma^0:\dot{F}^\ast\to F$ that maps as
$$
\bar\psi^{\dot{A}}=(\bar\sigma^0)^{\dot{A}B}(\psi_B)^\ast,\quad\psi_A=(\sigma_0)_{A\dot{B}}(\bar\psi^{\dot{B}})^\ast.
$$
So does the other Pauli matrics.

#### 2.4.5 Quadratic form and Fierz reordering
Denote the contraction of two Weyl spinor as
$$
(\psi\chi)\doteq\psi^A\chi_A,\quad(\bar\psi\bar\chi)\doteq\bar\psi_{\dot{A}}\bar\chi^{\dot{A}}.
$$
These are [[Grassmann variables#1.4 C-number and a-number|c-numbers]] which commutes with other Grassmann variables. These are also $\mathrm{SL}(2;\mathbb{C})$ invariant terms.

From the properties of Grassmann variables, one can write
- $(\psi\chi)=(\chi\psi)$ and $(\bar\psi\bar\chi)=(\bar\chi\bar\psi)$;
- $\theta_A\theta_B=\frac{1}{2}\epsilon_{AB}(\theta\theta)$, $\bar\theta_{\dot{A}}\bar\theta_{\dot{B}}=-\frac{1}{2}\epsilon_{\dot{A}\dot{B}}(\bar\theta\bar\theta)$;
- $(\theta\phi)(\theta\psi)=-\frac{1}{2}(\theta\theta)(\phi\psi)$;
- $(\phi\psi)\bar\chi_{\dot{A}}=\frac{1}{2}(\phi\sigma^\mu\bar\chi)(\psi\sigma_\mu)_{\dot{A}}$.

The last two properties are called *Fierz reordering formula*.
